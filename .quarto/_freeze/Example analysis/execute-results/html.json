This is a case-control study of (o)esophageal cancer in Ille-et-Vilaine, France.[@Breslow] The data frame contain the following variables:\n\n| *Variable name* | *What it refers*    |\n|-----------------|---------------------|\n| `agegp`         | Age group           |\n| `alcgp`         | Alcohol consumption |\n| `tobgp`         | Tobacco consumption |\n| `ncases`        | Number of cases     |\n| `ncontrols`     | Number of controls  |\n\nThe question that we can aim to answer with the data is the association between alcohol & tobacco consumption and the probability of getting esophageal cancer. The intended audiences for the data analysis are both researchers on that cancer and the corresponding clinical staff.\n\n![](images/EsophagusCancer.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"158\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- esoph\nhead(data, 15)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   agegp     alcgp    tobgp ncases ncontrols\n1  25-34 0-39g/day 0-9g/day      0        40\n2  25-34 0-39g/day    10-19      0        10\n3  25-34 0-39g/day    20-29      0         6\n4  25-34 0-39g/day      30+      0         5\n5  25-34     40-79 0-9g/day      0        27\n6  25-34     40-79    10-19      0         7\n7  25-34     40-79    20-29      0         4\n8  25-34     40-79      30+      0         7\n9  25-34    80-119 0-9g/day      0         2\n10 25-34    80-119    10-19      0         1\n11 25-34    80-119      30+      0         2\n12 25-34      120+ 0-9g/day      0         1\n13 25-34      120+    10-19      1         0\n14 25-34      120+    20-29      0         1\n15 25-34      120+      30+      0         2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Age is an important confounder\n\nFirst we can take a look at the age distribution of the study population, and the different patterns for alcohol & tobacco consumption of the young and the old.
